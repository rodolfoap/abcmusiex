Notes on first release 0.7-1:

- This release is created on C so then it can be appended with some open code from other abc suite software.
- Must have bugs. Just tested with some examples.
- Code does not validate any parameter entry.
- The program make some shell calls to other abc software, xpdf viewer and audio converters.
- The program just generates an abc file which then is converted to many formats. It is really simple.

Thanks to ABC standard writers and ABCPlus codemakers. Thanks to SourceForge, as always. If you have any doubt or wanna help me improve this work, just drop me a line.
